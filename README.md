# Guidelines
1. ______________________
2. Please inform each other on telegram if you are working on the project. Just do it to prevent any file overwrites. ~~Please I'm begging you this happened in my last project~~
3. Name your commits meaningfully so that we know what has been changed, e.g. no "first-commit, second-commit", do stuff like "Added 25 new maps".
4. Please do not delete the repository.
5. Please research about Github's quirks and features to prevent any accidental overwriting and tomfoolery.

Thanks for reading, üôè hopefully everything will go swimmingly...
